##### *Ever felt your factory buildings are too cuboid? Wished that your ramp walls were just that little bit steeper? Frustrated by the lack of options for sloped glass?*

**Ada's Aesthetic Assets** is a small decor mod which adds a few new variants of existing buildables that I felt were missing from Satisfactory's vanilla buildable catalogue. With these new advancements in structural engineering, it's now possible for you to construct:

* Narrower walls
* Ramp windows
* Tilted windows
* The old Left and Right Stairs (Yay!)
* A new set of "*Slanted*" walls and windows at an incline of 60° (8m high, 4m deep)
  * Slanted Walls & Steel Walls
  * Slanted Ramp Walls & Steel Ramp Walls
  * Slanted Windows
  * Slanted Glass Roofs
 * Automated recipes for leaves and wood    ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

All of these are available from a Tier 1 milestone at appropriate material costs, and are fully integrated with the vanilla node-placement building-system, painting, and zooping.

Now, even your architectural designs can be optimized to FISCIT-Approved benchmarks for geometric diversity!

You can find the buildables under these Build-Menu categories:
